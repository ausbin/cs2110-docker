Docker Image for CS 2110
========================

Overleaf with instructions: <https://v2.overleaf.com/read/zwczwxpnxgqp>

If you're in CS 2110 and on a Linux distro other than Ubuntu 16.04 or
on macOS, you can use this repository to make sure your code compiles
properly on our toolchain.

Run the respective `cs2110docker-*.sh` for your platform.

All of your work in the `cs2110-workdir` directory in your `Documents`
folder will be available as the current directory when you log into the
container.

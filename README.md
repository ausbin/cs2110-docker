Docker Image for CS 2110
========================

If you're in CS 2110 and on a Linux distro other than Ubuntu 16.04, you
can use this repository to make sure your code compiles properly on our
toolchain.

Note that this is not officially supported, but I (Austin) will try my
best.

You can use it with the following commands:

    $ git clone https://github.gatech.edu/CS2110/cs2110-docker.git
    $ cd cs2110-docker
    $ sudo -g docker ./run.sh

All of your work is in the `workdir/` directory.
